# Suggestions for this assignment
I think having an assignment to teach atomic operations such as transactions is important. I also think that synchronization and issues such as bad writes are prevalent in industry, so this assignment serves an important person. In terms of what I would do to improve this assignment, my main suggestion is specifying the requirements a bit more. It would also be interesting to encourage the usage of a real DBMS such a Postgre SQL. A lot of students at UF do not have experience using databases, specially if they took the Databases course with Kahveci.
